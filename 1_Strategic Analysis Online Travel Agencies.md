## 2.0 Dominant Business Models: Agency vs. Merchant 💰

OTA business models directly affect risk exposure, pricing power, and long-term profitability by defining the nature of the relationship with suppliers.

| Business Model 🏦 | Supplier Relationship & Payment Flow | Risk & Pricing Control | Financial Implications & Challenges |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agency Model** | OTA acts purely as a **commission broker**. The supplier (hotel/airline) controls the retail price and inventory; the customer pays the supplier directly. OTA receives a set commission rate. | **Low inventory and financial risk** for the OTA. Limited pricing control. | Highly predictable, low-risk cash flow. No upfront payment obligations to suppliers. |
| **Merchant Model** | OTA purchases services (e.g., room inventory) at **wholesale prices**, sets the retail price independently, and collects payment from the customer (becoming the **merchant of record**). | **High control over Dynamic Pricing** strategies. **Higher inventory risk** and greater financial risk exposure. | Requires significant investment in **FinTech solutions** (e.g., **Virtual Credit Cards - VCCs**) to manage operational risk, cash flow challenges, and increased **Fraud** exposure. |
| **Hybrid Approach** | Combines elements of both models, often integrating **metasearch** or content provisioning functions. | Varies based on the specific combination. | Allows for flexibility and diversification of revenue streams. |
