## 🏆 The Mastery Project: End-to-End Data Challenge

Welcome to the Mastery Project! This is your opportunity to apply everything you’ve learned in a real-world data challenge. The project is designed to simulate the type of data-driven decision-making you would be responsible for in a professional environment. You’ll work through data exploration, feature engineering, customer segmentation, and strategic recommendations, all while reinforcing your analytical and problem-solving skills.

This project is structured to mirror industry workflows, where you will go from understanding the problem to presenting a well-structured, data-backed strategy.

### Course Structure Overview
* **Week 1: Project Exploration:** Familiarize yourself with the dataset and business context.
* **Week 2: Feature Engineering & Customer Segmentation:** Execute Feature Engineering to improve data quality. Create meaningful data metrics to analyze user behavior.
* **Week 3: Developing Insights & Strategy:** Segment customers into distinct groups based on data patterns. Refine your data-driven recommendations based on customer insights.
* **Week 4: Presenting Your Findings:** Structure your final project submission with clear insights and justifications. Deliver a data-backed strategy in a professional format.

### What This Course Offers
* **Real-World Data Problem:** Work with a business dataset and develop a complete analytical solution.
* **End-to-End Project Experience:** Move through every stage of a data project, from exploration to strategic recommendations.
* **Portfolio-Ready Work:** Develop a structured project that showcases your analytical and storytelling skills.

## ✈️ Company: The TravelTide Company

### Context: Poor Customer Retention
E-booking startup TravelTide has maintained a hyper-focus on building the biggest travel inventory and making it easily searchable. Because of this narrow focus, certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in **poor customer retention**. CEO Kevin Talanick is motivated to retain and add value to existing customers with a Marketing strategy built on a solid understanding of customer behavior.

### Role of the Head of Marketing (Elena Tarrant)
Elena Tarrant, the new Head of Marketing, is an expert in **customer retention strategies**, specifically rewards programs. Elena believes that to grab customers’ attention and maximize the likelihood they will sign up, we must **emphasize the perk we think they are most interested in** when we ask them to sign up.

### Our Mission as Data Analysts
Our mission is two-fold:
1.  Check if the data supports Elena’s hypothesis about the existence of customers interested in the proposed perks.
2.  For each customer, **assign a likely favorite perk**.

## 🧭 Approaching the Project: Detailed Time Structure

In each of the four weeks, we will get one step further in our goal to help Elena and TravelTide!

### 1️⃣ EDA - Exploring the Data:
* **Goal:** Familiarize yourself with the business context and available data. Clean and prepare the data.
* **Outcome:** A cleaned, filtered table at the session level; a first aggregated table on a user level, ready for customer analysis.

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering - Devising Metrics:
* **Goal:** Perform **Feature Engineering** to devise metrics or new attributes that are meaningful for segmentation. Think about how customers in the travel business differ from each other.

### 3️⃣ Customer Segmentation - Grouping the Customers:
* **Goal:** Perform customer analysis using the created metrics. Use **clustering methods** (Machine Learning) to segment customers and determine the meaning of the computationally found groups.
* **Outcome:** The assignment of all suitable customers into groups based on segmentation criteria and an assigned perk that will suit them.

### 4️⃣ Presentation:
* **Goal:** Create an executive summary and slides of the customer analysis results. Describe the characteristics (behavior, preferences) of each customer group/cluster.
* **Deliverables:** Include recommendations on how to measure the success of the customer analysis in the upcoming months. Use data storytelling principles and good visualizations (bar plot, scatter plot, radar plot, etc.).
