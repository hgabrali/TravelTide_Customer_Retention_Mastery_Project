# 🎯 Optimal Perk Assignment: Data-Driven Segment Allocation

This table summarizes the core segment profiles, the key insights derived from the exploratory data analysis, and the corresponding optimal perk assignment strategy designed to maximize sign-up conversion and retention.

| Target Segment (Profile) | Key Insight (Derived from Analysis) 💡 | Optimal Perk Assignment (Actionable Strategy) 🎁 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High-Value/Low-Risk** (E.g., Married, High Spend) | **Low Cancellation Risk** (Marital Status Analysis) & **High Core Value** (Base Fare Analysis). | **Complimentary Cancellation Insurance / Free Cancellation:** Rewards commitment and offers high-value customers a premium, friction-reducing benefit. |
| **Discount-Sensitive Females** (Flights Focus) | **Highest Discount Sensitivity for Flights** (Discount Optimization Analysis) & **Primary Driver of Flight Volume** (Booking Volume Analysis). | **Exclusive Flight Voucher/Discount:** Direct response to proven price sensitivity on the primary product (Flights), maximizing conversion rate (CRO). |
| **High-Risk/High-Intent Males** (Hotel Focus) | **Higher Hotel Booking Propensity** & **Lower Cancellation Risk when Married** (Booking/Cancellation Analysis). | **Tiered Hotel Voucher/Discount:** Leverage their preference for the higher-margin product (Hotels) while mitigating risk by restricting deep flight discounts. |
| **Low-Engagement Majority** (Tier 1 Users) | **High Conversion Funnel Leakage** & **Low Transactional Sessions** (Engagement Analysis). | **Targeted Re-Engagement Campaign:** Focus on offering short-term, low-value incentives to move users past the 75th percentile click threshold. |


# 2. 🎯 Actionable Strategy: Targeted Marketing Campaign

This section outlines how the assigned optimal perks (Perk Assignment) will be delivered to customers, translating our analytical findings into a concrete marketing strategy.

## Campaign Pillars

* **Objective:** Maximize the **Sign-up Rate** by aligning the personalized perk with the customer's segmented profile. This is the primary success metric for the initial deployment.

* **Methodology:** Deliver **Personalized Invitation Messaging** (Validating Elena's Hypothesis).
    > *Example:* "Based on your preference for secure bookings, enjoy **Free Cancellation** when you sign up today."

* **Core Focus: Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) 📈**
    We are optimizing the **initial communication touchpoint** (the invitation) to maximize enrollment in the rewards program, treating the sign-up as a key conversion event.

* **Funnel Optimization: Prioritize Optimizing the User Experience (UX) 🛠️**
    We must optimize the search and checkout processes for the **low-engagement majority** to reduce early abandonment. (Ref: Conversion Efficiency Insight). A better UX reduces friction and increases the likelihood of long-term engagement.


  # 3. 🧪 Measuring Success (Future Work & A/B Testing)

This section defines the rigorous measurement framework (A/B Test) required to prove the success of the personalized perk assignment strategy and outlines steps for model integration.

| Focus Area | Metric Definition | Interpretation & Actionable KPI 📊 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A/B Testing Framework** | **Control Group:** Receives generic invitation message (no personalized perk emphasis). | **Targeted Group:** Receives personalized message emphasizing the assigned optimal perk. |
| **Primary KPI** | **Perk Sign-up Rate (Conversion)** | The primary measure of the strategy's success. We expect a statistically significant **Lift Analysis** in the targeted group's conversion rate. |
| **Secondary KPIs** | **Customer Retention Rate** (Post-Sign-up), **Average Order Value (AOV)**, and **Future Cancellation Rate** (Segment-specific). | These metrics validate the long-term impact on **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and risk mitigation. |
| **Feature Integration** | Incorporating Marital Status and Discount Sensitivity into the predictive feature space. | Using these insights to refine the **Cancellation Probability Model** and **LTV Model** for ongoing strategic optimization. |
